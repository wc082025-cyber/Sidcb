About this project.
    A cleaner way of doing the fundementals and a way of learning to code so it gets in my fingers, and truly get the fundemantal understandings to lock itself to my brain.

    The project is named after its classes. Sidcb
    String Inter Double Char Bool.

    Each in its own class to make the main program cleaner, and to ensure each program can be edited with ease. As we have been told over and over, put it in classes. This is an example of this.

    Everything I can put in a different class to clean up the program class should be in its own class.


# Update
    As you told me would work. I did some digging, and i found out how to clean up my main code to what it should look like when using many classes.

    Where I got the idea in the first place is a funny thing. Its actually from an episode of silicon valley where Richard is in his office and puts post it notes on a board of all the modules he has finished.
    I figured that this is kind of the same thing, and if many people are working together on a project, this is kind of how it would work. Everyone codes one file, and someone glues it all together using kind of the technuiqe i am using on this. 

    All classes are in a separate file, and then i use a GetAll class where I glue them all together and call them in my main class.

    As fundementals go, this is me being on the path to create code thats easy to read and understand. Clear naming, and clean program class whare there is only the essentials exept for some whitespace to make it even more readable and easy to work on for others.

    Only thing this code is missing for now, is comments on what the lines do. But as each output kind of explain the purpose of the code, i didnt fint it nessesary to do so this time.
