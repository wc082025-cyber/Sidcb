About this project.
    A cleaner way of doing the fundementals and a way of learning to code so it gets in my fingers, and truly get the fundemantal understandings to lock itself to my brain.

    The project is named after its classes. Sidcb
    String Inter Double Char Bool.

    Each in its own class to make the main program cleaner, and to ensure each program can be edited with ease. As we have been told over and over, put it in classes. This is an example of this.

    Everything I can put in a different class to clean up the program class should be in its own class.
